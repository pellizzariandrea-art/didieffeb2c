			Who we are		
			Since 1982, manufacturers of handles 
and fittings for door and window frames		
		
In over fourty years of operation, we have built on a centuries-old tradition, according to which the metalworker and carpenter joined forces to create a product with a perfect blend between the art of metalworking and carpentry.

We have transformed craftsman's espertise into industrial efficiency without betraying its principles, but rather by developing its potential.

The interpretation of an ancient trade at risk of extinction has allowed Didieffe to give a future horizon to a product rich in history.

			Production		
			
### From concept to product

We are an organization with a strong product and market identity, acquired with tenacity and hard work, first locally and subsequently on an international scale. This is due to know-how and to a production cycle that starts with the concept and is then translated into the product.

Although our production is extremely heterogeneous, we have never forgotten that every product offered must achieve excellence. Accordingly, care and dedication to improvement is an ongoing and essential aspect of all our product lines. 

The experience gained in the craft of woodworking has allowed us, over time, to go beyond the traditional fields of application, leading us to adapt our products not only to traditional window frames, but also to modern PVC and aluminium frames.

Today Didieffe handles and fittings are distributed and marketed in Italy, in EU countries and beyond these borders, contributing to sustaing **100% Made in Italy**, of PDO products that combine the charm of the past with the rationality and efficiency of future technology.

			Our history		
			Tradition, creativity
and craftsmanship		
		
Our aim is to grow in a harmonious way with respect for the territory, through the realisation of ideas and products that lead to shared and environmentally sustainable satisfaction.
