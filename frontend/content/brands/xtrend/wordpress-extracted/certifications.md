QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENT:  

A CONNUBE
INSCINDIBLE		
		
The quality of a product is the result of strict control of each production stage combined with constant verification of customers, materials, industrial processes and supply chain.

Didieffe has been certified under ISO 9001:2015 since 2004 and with commitment and constancy bases its actions on the logic of continuous improvement and analysis of risks and opportunities.

Since 2020, we have also obtained the important ISO 14001:2015 environmental management certification, a strong indication of our willingness to operate with full respect for the environment and our desire to make increasingly sustainable products in all aspects of production and distribution.
