## SPECIAL FINISHES

**PVD ***(Physical Vapor Deposition*) treatment is a vacuum coating process used to deposit a thin layer of material on a surface. This process involves the vaporization of solid material in the form of a thin film, which is deposited on the surface of an object in a vacuum chamber.

**Benefits of PVD treatment include:**

- Improvements in surface properties: PVD coating can improve the surface properties of objects, such as hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance.

- Aesthetics: PVD treatment is often used to give objects an aesthetic finish, offering a range of metallic colors and finishes.

- Friction reduction: By applying thin layers of specialized materials, PVD treatment can reduce friction and improve the performance of mechanical parts.

- Increased durability: Adding a protective layer through PVD can increase the durability of items such as tools, mechanical components, and cutting tools.

- Technology applications: PVD treatment is widely used in the electronics industry and microelectronic device manufacturing to improve the performance and durability of components.

- Extremely eco-friendly: compared with some other coating processes, PVD is considered a more environmentally friendly method because it is carried out in a vacuum environment, reducing the emission of pollutants.

In general, PVD treatment has applications in a wide range of industries, including the automotive industry, the tool industry, electronics, construction, and many others, due to its many advantages.

In our applications, it is of particular interest to recall both **corrosion resistance** and increased **surface hardness**.

In the first case, the corrosion resistance offered by a PVD coating depends on the specific type of material used in the process. However, in general, PVD coatings are known to significantly improve the corrosion resistance of treated surfaces. Some materials commonly used in PVD coatings, such as titanium nitride (TiN), chromium nitride (CrN), and other compounds, offer excellent anti-corrosion properties.

The benefits of corrosion resistance come from the coating's ability to create a protective barrier on the surface of the treated object. This barrier can protect the underlying material from corrosive agents such as moisture, harsh chemicals, and other elements that can cause damage.

It is important to note that corrosion resistance may vary depending on environmental conditions, type of exposure and the base material of the treated object. For example, in highly corrosive maritime or industrial applications, it may be necessary to use specific PVD coatings designed to withstand such aggressive environments.

In the case of increased hardness, we can say that PVD treatment is known to impart significant hardness to the surface of treated objects. Typically, PVD coatings, such as titanium nitride (TiN) or chromium nitride (CrN), can achieve high levels of hardness on the Vickers scale that reach over 1800HV, this suggests that this value, represents a significant improvement over what can be achieved with traditional chrome or nickel plating treatments. Artifacts treated by this method will be less susceptible to scoring, denting, accidental bumps, and wear and tear over time.
