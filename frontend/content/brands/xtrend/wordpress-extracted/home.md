### Technological heart

The grub screw can be replaced by the joint screws without affecting the strength of the handle-rosette coupling.

The special threading of the screws ensures that the cross-threading effect is avoided.

The framework acts independently between the two handles: in an emergency, therefore, one handle will always be functional.

A self-adjusting spring allows the panel to adapt to doors of different thicknesses.

### X-Trend on demand

As in the process of developing a handcrafted item, in X-Trend the guidelines are defined by the client himself who, according to his own creative flair or based on specific needs, has the freedom to completely customize the product, with the difference being that advanced technologies are available for its realization.

The result is handles and hardware for furniture, doors and windows that make a Client's design a reality.
