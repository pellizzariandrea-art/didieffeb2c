## SUSTAINABILITY GOALS

Didieffe not only complies with the standards of **ISO 14001 certification**, but also engages every day in an active path of sustainable evolution.

We constantly monitor our production processes, orienting them toward a low environmental impact model, setting ambitious and measurable goals.

Prominent among these is our commitment to the **“zero emissions”** goal, which we pursue through the annual calculation of our carbon footprint in all three areas (Scope 1, 2 and 3).

We produce some of the energy we need from our own **photovoltaic system** and carefully select suppliers who guarantee the renewable **origin of the remaining energy.**

Sustainability, for us, is not a trend: it is a responsibility. And it is an integral part of the way we are, produce and think about the future.
