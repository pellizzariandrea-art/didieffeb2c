## Classic Anthology, timeless elegance of handcrafted handles

**Antologia Classica** is a tribute to the elegance of ancient forms, a journey through time through handles forged in iron and brass, living and sincere materials.Each piece is born from the hands of Italian artisans, who turn metal into a story: sculpted details, surfaces full of memory, curves that evoke the beauty of the authentic.

Designed for environments where history meets design, this collection restores value to the daily act of opening a door by making it ritual, style, emotion.

## THE ANCIENT GESTURE, THE MODERN THOUGHT

In every **Didieffe** signature handle there is the imprint of an ancient knowledge, that of craftsmanship, made of skilled hands, slow time and love for details.But behind this beauty there is much more: there is a clear, modern vision made of order, respect and responsibility.

**We believe that quality is not just a result, but a method.**And that is why we have chosen to combine the soul of craftsmanship with the rigor of certified processes:our production complies with **ISO 9001** standards for quality and **ISO 14001** standards for the environment-because doing well also means doing right.

Every project, every client, every product is a promise for us: to offer beauty, solidity, and transparency.And our **digital catalog** is the open door to this world: a place to discover, choose, and imagine, with the simplicity and care that sets us apart.

**Didieffe** is where tradition becomes method, and method becomes emotion.
