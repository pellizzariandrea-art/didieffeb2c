## ABOUT US
				
					Since 1982 manufacturers of handles
and hardware for window frames				
		
In **over forty years of business,** we have been able to enhance a centuries-old tradition whereby the blacksmith worked alongside the carpenter to create a product that is the perfect synthesis between metalworking and the art of woodworking.

We transformed craftsmanship into industrial efficiency without betraying its principles, on the contrary, evolving its potential.

The interpretation of an ancient craft at risk of extinction has enabled Didieffe to give a future horizon to a product rich in history.

## PRODUCTION

Our mission is to provide complete, state-of-the-art solutions for shading systems, responding precisely to the needs of the modern market. Specializing in hinges, latches and other window components, we are committed to high performance, functional design and maximum reliability.

In an ever-changing market, we have adopted an efficiency-oriented manufacturing approach, integrating Lean methodologies and the Kaizen principle of continuous improvement. Each stage of our process is designed to optimize time, cost and quality, with the goal of always delivering maximum value to our customers.
